The current folder contains minimal set of scripts used to perform differential expression analysis and functional characterization of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

R Markdown scripts:
* `run_gseKegg.Rmd`: generates gene expression heatmaps of top-enriched KEGG pathways in *E. coli* K-12 and Nissle 1917 strains (`Figure 6`).
* `plot_qrtPCR_growth.Rmd`: plots results of qRT-PCR (`Figure 4`) and growth curves experiments (`Figure 5`).
