# Sulfoquinovose catabolism in *E. coli* strains: compositional and functional divergence of *yih* gene cassettes

This repository contains a minimal set of scripts used in our study to:

- process RNA-seq data (trimming, mapping, quantification),
- perform differential expression analysis (DESeq2, clusterProfiler),
- and annotate the phylogenetic distribution of *yih* cassette variants across *E. coli* strains.
