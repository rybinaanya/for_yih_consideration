# Sulfoquinovose catabolism in *E. coli* strains: compositional and functional divergence of *yih* gene cassettes

This repository contains a minimal set of scripts used in our study to:

- process RNA-seq data (trimming, mapping, quantification),
- perform differential expression analysis (DESeq2, clusterProfiler),
- and annotate the phylogenetic distribution of *yih* cassette variants across *E. coli* strains.



## Data availability

Raw RNA-seq reads are available from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession [PRJNA1338229](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1338229).

The phylogenetic tree used in this study was obtained from Seferbekova et al. (2021):  
**High Rates of Genome Rearrangements and Pathogenicity of *Shigella* spp.** *Front. Microbiol.*  
[https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.628622](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.628622)

Tree annotations and metadata were generated as part of this repository (see `phylogeny/` folder).
